🌍 Language Support
The chatbot should respond in English or French based on the user’s language selection on the site.

🤖 Conversational Intelligence
Make the chatbot feel friendly, slightly funny, helpful, and modern.

Include emojis in responses 🎉

Casual tone, reacts like a chill junior dev or friend.

Add jokes if the user asks for one.

Detect offensive language and respond with:

EN: “Woah buddy, don’t use that here 😅”

FR: “Oula, pas de gros mots ici stp 😬”

Respond to simple math questions like “1+1” or “what’s 5x6”

Use fallback answers like:

EN: "Hmm, not sure about that! Maybe email me?"

FR: "Pas sûr de ça ! Tu peux m’envoyer un email 😉"

🧠 Smart Slang & Casual Input Understanding
The chatbot should understand slang, typos, shorthand, and informal messages in both English and French. Implement fuzzy matching or an alias system to normalize these inputs before matching them to your Q&A pairs.
